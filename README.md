Overview

In this project, I use the sobel filter and the colar mask to detect the lane in a video and write out the video with lane highlighted. The reason why the color mask ist so important in this case lies on the light condition. A color mask in HLS color space react robust to shadow.

The right lane is a little jumpy, i'm still working on that point. In the future I want to try the feature detector for lane detection.
